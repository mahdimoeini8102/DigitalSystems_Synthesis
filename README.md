This is the third project of the Digital System course at the university under the supervision of [Dr. Zainalabedin Navabi Shirazi](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en/~navabi) and it's about RT Level Components and Iterative Logic desgin using SystemVerilog HDL(Hardware Description Language) and it provides an introduction to a synthesis tool called "yosys".
# Parts of project
You can see the [CA & Report](https://github.com/mahdimoeini8102/DigitalSystems_Synthesis/tree/main/CA%20%26%20Report) folder which includes a description of the project and the report in which I wrote and the [Codes](https://github.com/mahdimoeini8102/DigitalSystems_Synthesis/tree/main/Codes) folder which includes all my codes in SystemVerilog HDL.
There is a file named "yosys.rar" that is a simple synthesis tool and is provided by teacher assistants of the course. It contains all information you need to work with it and I used it to synthesize my codes.
